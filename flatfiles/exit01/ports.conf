#        This file controls port speed, aggregation and subdivision.
#
# For example, the QSFP28 ports can be split into multiple interfaces. This
# file sets the number of interfaces per port and the speed of those interfaces.
#
# You must restart switchd for changes to take effect.
#
# mlnx,x86_MSN2100 has:
#     16 QSFP28 ports numbered 1-16
#         These ports are configurable as 40G, 50G, 2x50G, or 100G; or a subset
#         of them can be split into 4x25G or 4x10G.
#

# QSFP28 ports
#
# <port label>    = [40G|50G|100G]
#   or when split = [2x50G|4x10G|4x25G]
